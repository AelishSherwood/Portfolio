               My name is <strong>Aelish Sherwood</strong>. 
               I am a 24 year-old, who loves to code. 
                In my opinion, there aren't many feelings
                that compare to the one I get when I solve
                complex computer problems and accomplish new and complex
                tasks. Every problem presents an opportunity to build 
                a new skill.

        <h2>How Did I Get Into Coding?</h2>
           <p class="des1">
                I've been interested in computers for 
                as long as I can remember. My grandmother still 
                reminds me that, from age 8-15, I always had my christmas
                money spent on computers through online orders before I'd even recieved it. 
                Once I had built a collection of computers
                 and accessories I began fooling around with coding in C++ and ultimately
                  used that skill to create a <em>Windows Application</em> while I was still 
                  in High School.

        <h2>What I've Done</h2>
            <p class="des1">
                I've taken on a variety of tasks of my own accord. These things include but are not limited to- 
                <ul>
                <li><h4>Exercise App</h4>
                    <p class="des1">
                        I built an app using the programming language C++ when I was still in highschool.
                        This was a Windows Application designed to prescribe a workout to an individual (the User)
                        based on body measurements that the individual provides. The different workout routines were designed
                        to target muscle groups that needed developing in order to reach the most desirable "golden ratio"
                        figure.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <h4>Lonesome Mountain Builders, llc.</h4>
                <p class="des1">
                    With this company, I designed and built, at the age of 19, their whole website with
                    Squarespace and have since updated a few times when the owner has required.
                    And while Squarespace requires little in the way of coding and for this reason, 
                    lacks critical efficiences that coding languages provide, it stands as a skill on its own, 
                    learning to navigate the UI.
                </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>This Website</h4>
                    <p class="des1">
                        I built this website to demonstrate my coding skills and create a fully customized platform 
                        for distributing my content and marketing myself.
                    </p>

                        This is where I spill my thoughts on particular subjects if anyone cares to read. Through
                        creating this, I had to learn how to create, store, and manage data.
